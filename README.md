# challenge-1-refactoring-horiseon

## Description
  
  The website that was provided to us was designed to help people understand some tools of website utilities. 
  As our first week's challenge we were tasked with refactoring the source code of the Horiseons website. Most of 
  What needed to be edited were the HTML semantic and non-semantic elements, as well as their structure. To elaborate 
  we had an excess use of {div}. We eventually added the correlating semantic elements to each part of the code. 
  In addition to this we were asked to implement some accessibility features. The focus were primarily alt labels
  on the images used for other developers to examine and boost search engine relevance. We also needed to revised 
  the CSS structure, this involved a lot of consolidating within the classes and IDs, mostly removing repetitive classes. 
  The structure of the code was finally put in the proper sequential order. Lastly we needed to add a proper title in 
  the HTML head instead of "website" so our users know what site they are on as well as to also improve search engine 
  relevance
